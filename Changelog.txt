2.11.0
	Recompile for KSP 1.12

2.10
	Recompile for KSP 1.10.1.
	Also includes new hyper warp presets, allowing you to change hyper rate and physics rate to a predefined set of choices, much like rails warp.

2.9.9
	Version 2.9.9 (KSP 1.9.1)
	Added new Hyper Warping feature that works in a "Stockalike" way - a list of editable custom hyper warp rates and physics settings that can be used to slowly increase/decrease hyper warp in a controlled way
	Added buttons & key bindings to increase/decrease hyper warp by these settings
	Added new 'Warp to Node Start Burn Time' feature
	Added buttons on quick and rails warp to go to the 'start burn time' (also 10 and 30 sec prior)
	Added key binding for warping to start burn time - X seconds

2.9.8
	KSP 1.9.1 compatibility. Loosely tested.

2.9.7
	KSP 1.8.1 Support.

2.9.6
	KSP 1.6.1 Recompile

2.9.5
	KSP 1.5.1 Recompile
	Allow warp directly from PAUSE when paused via TimeControl
	Fix IndexOutOfRange exception on scene changes

2.9.4
KSP 1.4.5 recompile.

2.9.3
	Recompile for KSP 1.4.4

2.9.2
	Update for KSP 1.4.3

2.9.1
	KSP 1.4.2. Compatibility

2.9
	KSP 1.4.1 Compatibility
	Removed MiniAVC (kept Version file)

2.8.3
	For KSP 1.3.1

	A few bug fixes and enchancements

	Automatically reset maximumDeltaTime to the PHYSICS_FRAME_DT_LIMIT after physics warp bug enhancement
	Fixed Physics Accuracy +/- not working correctly on slider
	Fixed Hyper-Warp/Slow Mo Screen messages do not include stats when GUI is disabled (toggle performance stats on ? screen)
	Hyper Warp now allows you to set very high MaximumDeltaTime values that only apply during hyper warp. This will reduce your frame rate but possibly speed up Hyper Warp a little bit so long as the engine is not physics-limited

2.8.2
	Massive Keybindings update for the Discerning Gamer.

	Bind nearly every TimeControl action to a hotkey or key combination. Bind multiple actions to the same set of keys e.g. (activate hyper warp + set rate to 8). Key binds for quick warp to specific times / orbit locations.

	Also includes a bug fix to resource converters at high time warps using code graciously provided by @linuxgurugamer.

2.8.1
	Release for KSP 1.3.1. Fixed version file and compile issue with prior 2.8 release.

2.7
	Major Refactoring. Updated GUI, Settings, added quickwarp and warp-to tabs.

	KSP 1.3 compatibility.


2.5
	Thanks to @linuxgurugamer for updates for KSP 1.2.2. Changed the little button to close the window instead of minimizing.

	No other bugs fixed for this release.

2.4
	KSP 1.2.1 Compatibility.
	MiniAVC removed until AVC is updated for 1.2.1.
	Fixes bug for "Homeworld Time" breaking RSS Time Formatter. Will rethink this feature...

2.3.1
	Fix for toolbar integration due to Contract Configurator


2.3
	KSP 1.2 Compatibility.

	New 1.2 version of MiniAVC.

	Fixes bug where debris leaving the physics area causes hyper warp to cut out on current vessel.

	Fixes bug where it was saving the game settings in the editor view, which was breaking editor extensions redux. Thanks to linuxgurugamer.

2.2.2
	Doh. 2.2.1 had a slow-motion bug when returning to 1x. Corrected

2.2.1
	Version 2.2.1 (KSP 1.1.3)

	Bug fix: TC will no longer interfere with the stock warp to on rails.

	Remove some string concatenation from the OnGUI calls

2.2.0
	Version 2.2 (KSP 1.1.3)

	Logging mode now is properly set up with the settings file as well as in the Settings GUI. Defaulting to INFO mode.
	Save warp rates, altitudes, window positions, and settings every X seconds is now in the Settings GUI as well. Defaults to 5 seconds. Note that if you have made no changes, it does not perform a save.
	"Homeworld Timekeeping" option added. If you have modified things with Kopernicus and this is turned on, "Use Kerbin Time" will set up your calendar so that 1 day = 1 sidereal day, and 1 year = 1 sidereal year

2.1.0
Version 2.1 (KSP 1.1.3)

	Screen Messages now stay on until you change warp. They can be toggled off in the settings menu.
	Replaced label at top right of TC window with a button that cancels the warp type as well as cancelling PAUSE.
	Auto Rails Warp now uses custom code, it appears to be very accurate.
	Auto Rails warp now has the ability to pause when you reach the time requested.
	Rails warp when you first go to the flight window now uses the correct warp rates.
	Logging mode now is properly set up with the settings file. Defaulting to INFO mode.
	Corrected issue when changing a scene, if you had time paused, it would break the game.

2.0.2
KSP 1.1.3 compatibility.

	Major rewrite. See change log for details.
	Version numbering updated.

1.1.2
	It seems like Hyper Warp performs loads better in KSP 1.1.2!

	This still needs a UI rewrite. Anyone with skills in unity canvas UI that can help me I'd be grateful.

	I removed the calls to the object collision code. I tested in low orbit at super high warp and I got 180 days in 10 seconds with no blow ups when returning to normal speed.

1.0.5
	Recompile for 1.0.5.

	Still has the bug where if you leave Kerbin's SOI in a vessel and then return to the space center you can't click on space center stuff. Switch to a vessel in kerbin orbit before returning to get around it.

	Hope to rebuild for Unity 5 KSP.

1.0.4 HF 2
	Fixes the log spam with a configurable setting to turn off debug logging. Logging is disabled by default

1.0.4 hotfix
	Same as last release just corrected the app launcher button

1.0.4
	Fixed black screen after switching SOI (PQSCity objects were never re-activated from the bugfix for the explosions).

	Fixed mixed references to CelestialBody.bodyName and CelestialBody.name (should fix RSS issues).

	I think the input locks not working right has been corrected as well

1.0.2
	Use atmosphereDepth
